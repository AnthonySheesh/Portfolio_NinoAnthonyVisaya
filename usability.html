    Brainly.ph is an online learning platform that provides answers to various questions on subjects such as math, science, and history. The target audience of Brainly.ph are students and individuals who are looking for help with their homework or other academic pursuits.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Purpose
  </h2>
  <p>
    In a study of Brainly.ph, the three tasks assigned to subjects were: 
    <ol>
      <li>finding the answer to a specific question</li>
      <li>navigating to a related topic</li>
      <li>locating and using a specific feature of the site (such as the search bar or the "ask a question" button)</li>
    </ol> 
  </p>
  <h2>
Result
  </h2>
  <p>
    The results of the study showed that subjects were able to complete the tasks assigned to them, with varying levels of ease. On average, it took subjects several steps and several minutes to complete the tasks.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Discussion
 </h2>
 <p>
  The study showed that the current design of Brainly.ph is generally effective, but there is room for improvement. For example, the site could be designed to better highlight important features or to make it easier for users to navigate between questions and answers. Additionally, the site could be optimized for mobile devices to make it more accessible to users on the go.
