00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:21.510
I can think of all the times
You told me not to touch the light

2
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.023
I never thought that you would be the one

3
00:00:27.233 --> 00:00:30.944
I couldn't really justify

4
00:00:30.944 --> 00:00:38.709
How you even thought it could be right
Cause everything we cherished is gone

5
00:00:39.114 --> 00:00:54.546
And in the end can you tell me if
It was worth the try, so I can decide

6
00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.103
Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of
trees

7
00:01:01.103 --> 00:01:06.986
And all will be alright in time

8
00:01:06.986 --> 00:01:13.864
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas

9
00:01:13.864 --> 00:01:19.441
And all will be alright in time

10
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:28.665
Oh you never really love someone until you learn to forgive

11
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.549
Try as hard as I might

12
00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.093
To flee the shadows of the night

13
00:01:47.093 --> 00:01:52.756
It haunts me and it makes me feel blue

14
00:01:52.756 --> 00:02:04.272
But how can I try to hide
When every breath and every hour I still end up thinking of you

15
00:02:04.272 --> 00:02:13.759
And in the end, everything we have makes it worth the fight

16
00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:18.965
So I will hold on for as long as

17
00:02:18.965 --> 00:02:25.245
Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees

18
00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:31.697
And all will be alright in time

19
00:02:31.697 --> 00:02:37.542
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas

20
00:02:37.542 --> 00:02:43.104
And all will be alright in time

21
00:02:43.104 --> 00:02:51.629
Oh you never really love someone until you learn to forgive

22
00:02:51.629 --> 00:03:03.327
I never thought that I would see the day that I'd decide if I should leave or stay

23
00:03:03.327 --> 00:03:07.349
But in the end what makes it worth the fight

24
00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:18.230
Is that no matter what happens we try to make it right

25
00:03:20.615 --> 00:03:26.492
Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees

26
00:03:26.492 --> 00:03:33.000
And all will be alright in time

27
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.167
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas

28
00:03:39.167 --> 00:03:44.793
And all will be alright in time

29
00:03:44.855 --> 00:03:50.301
Wounds of the past will eventually heal

30
00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:56.851
I said all will be alright in time

31
00:03:56.851 --> 00:04:02.387
'Cause all of this comes with a love that is real

32
00:04:02.387 --> 00:04:20.457
I said all will be alright in time

33
00:04:20.457 --> 00:04:26.287
And all will be alright in time

34
00:04:26.371 --> 00:04:31.768
Oh you never really love someone until

35
00:04:31.768 --> 00:04:45.447
You learn to forgive

36
00:04:45.447 --> 00:04:49.936
Learn to forgive
